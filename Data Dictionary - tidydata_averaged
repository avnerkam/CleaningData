Data Dictionary - tidydata_averaged
(originated from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset.)

subject
numeric representing a uniqe human subject
activity

measurements taken while performing one of the following:
walking
walking up
walking down
sitting
standing
laying

The following are 68 types of measurements taken during activity, averaged for each subject / activity
(only mean and std related features included in tidydata)

Note that according to the UCI HAR documentation:
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 
3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals 
(prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner 
frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity 
acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner 
frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
